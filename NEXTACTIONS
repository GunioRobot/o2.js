# So What's Next?

- Write a formatting guideline, on what conventions are used in o2.js
(indendations, naming conventions, spaces etc.)
- Prepare unit tests
- Identify target platforms (my aim is to support IE7+, and to hell
with IE6)
- Minor feature implementations and refactoring.
- Add documentation.
- Add examples.
- Keep this list up-to-date.
