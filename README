It's me: Volkan! Jack of all Trades, Sensei of JavaScript ;)

Since 2003, I've been doing front-end development on client-heavy AJAX web 
applications. 

Currently, I'm a *VP of Technology* at http://grou.ps/, a well-known 
do-it-yourself social networking platform that allows people to come together
and form interactive communities around a shared interest or affiliation. 

Before that, I was a *JavaScript Engineer* at http://www.livego.com/, a globally 
known social mash-up. 

Before that, I was the *Chief Technology Officer* of a business network 
(cember.net) which was acquired by Xing AG for around 4.2M Euros.

About o2.js
________________________________________________________________________________

Up till now, I've used various JavaScript structures, analyzed almost all of 
the popular JavaScript frameworks, and have built a dozen of JavaScript 
libraries, from the ground up, myself.

Front-end development and front-end performance optimization has always been my 
passion. And at o2.js, I aim to reflect this passion.

With o2.js, I'll be diving deep into the realm of JavaScript, while  trying to 
seek out mostly library-independent solutions. I will be sharing my experiences
along the way at http://o2js.com/

*Seriously, though: what's with the "o2" thing?*

It’s geekish — you know ;) .

“o2” is the chemical symbol of “oxygen“.

In the land of heavy-weight JavaScript libraries, o2.js will be like fresh air:

    * It will be fast,
    * it will be flexible,
    * it will be reliable.

We will be building all of our examples around the “o2” namespace and, 
as time goes by, it will evolve to a modular, lightweight utility package.

Let us get our hands dirty... and we'll see how it goes along ;)
