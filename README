About o2.js
________________________________________________________________________________

Front-end development and front-end performance optimization has always been my 
passion. And at o2.js, I aim to reflect this passion:

    * o2.js will be fast,
    * o2.js will be flexible,
    * and o2.js will be reliable.
    
"In the land of heavy JavaScript libraries, o2.js will be like fresh oxygen ;)"

o2.js is in still in its growth phase with a pretty stable code base.

Yet Another JavaScript Framework?! Seriously? But Why?
________________________________________________________________________________

Well, o2.js is not and end-result. It is a "by-product". Let me explain:

Up till now, I've used various JavaScript techniques, analyzed and used almost 
all of the popular JavaScript frameworks, and have built a dozen of JavaScript 
libraries, from the ground up, myself.

In that regard, my aim was *not* to develop yet another JavaScript framework. 
My goal was to blog about peculiarities, intricacies, best-practices, patterns, 
use-cases, implementations of re-usable, cross-platform, optimized JavaScript 
code at http://o2js.com/.

As a result, at http://o2js.com/ I dived deep into the realm of JavaScript, while 
trying to seek out library-independent solutions, sharing my experiences along
the way. I still actively blog and continue sharing my knowledge and 
experience there.

Ironically enough, while blogging at http://o2js.com, I realized that the code 
snippets that I was mixing together as blog posts evolved into a solid and 
re-usable JavaScript framework. 

Hope you like the outcome ;)
